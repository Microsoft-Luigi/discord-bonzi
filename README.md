# discord-bonzi



This Bonzi Buddy as a discord bot, a fun little project I created 5 years ago in 2021.

Unlike his real life counterpart, he is harmless.



Since bonzi can play music and talk he has the following dependencies:



installed through pip:

&nbsp;	-PyNaCl

&nbsp;	-python-dotenv

&nbsp;	-yt-dlp

&nbsp;	-discord.py



additional required operating system modules:

&nbsp;	-ffmpeg
